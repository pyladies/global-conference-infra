# Create GDrive folder

## Local environment setup

1. Create and activate the virtual environment, e.g.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the dependencies

```
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Speaker email address list

Create the email address as a csv file. See example in ``sample_speaker_file.csv``.
The file can be generated by exporting from Pretalx: Export speaker name, email address, and proposal title from all the confirmed speakers.

## Create GDrive folder and grant permission

1. Run the ``generate_gdrive_folder.py`` script. You may need to adjust the speaker column based on the csv file. Also
   check the email message to be sent prior to run the script.

This command will create a folder in PyLadiesCon GDrive, and share the folder with each speaker.

It will also output a CSV containing the path to the GDrive folder for each speaker.
