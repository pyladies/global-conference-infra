We\u2019ll cover the fundamentals, including the difference between weak and strong learners. Then, we'll dive into key techniques: Bagging, which trains models independently in parallel; Boosting, which sequentially strengthens weak models; and Stacking, which merges models to create a more generalized and robust model. Whether you're a data scientist or just curious, this talk will deepen your understanding of these powerful techniques.",

To stay on course, I came up with a simple mental model to help create an effective tech toolkit. These guiding principles inspired the creation of [DataJourney](https://github.com/sayantikabanik/DataJourney).\r\n\r\n#### Questions, which I ask to get started\r\n\r\n**Start with the Why: What Are Your Goals?**\r\nAsk: What\u2019s the main purpose of this workflow? What problem are we solving?\r\n\r\n**Identify the Pain Points: Where Are the Gaps?**\r\nAsk: What challenges or bottlenecks are we facing? What\u2019s missing in our current setup?\r\n\r\n**Simplify the Options: What Tools Fit Our Needs?**\r\nAsk: Which tools address our pain points without adding unnecessary complexity?\r\n\r\n**Focus on Reproducibility: How Do We Ensure Consistency?**\r\nAsk: How can we make this workflow easy to repeat and share with others?\r\n\r\n**Build with Flexibility: How Can We Adapt Over Time?**\r\nAsk: Are the tools chosen scalable?\r\n\r\n**Test and Learn: How Does It Work in Practice?**\r\nAsk: How can we test this setup quickly? What feedback can we gather to improve it?\r\n\r\n**Iterate and Improve: What\u2019s the Next Step?**\r\nAsk: What worked well, and what needs tweaking? How can we optimize further?\r\n\r\n**Outcome** is a tool-kit which is customised, and scalable. All powered with open-source \ud83d\udc9c",

We will explore how to integrate the community\u2019s core values with practical operations to create a learning and practice environment that inspires members' enthusiasm. Specific topics include how to design appropriate workshops based on the background of community participants, how to ensure that workshop content is deeply aligned with community values, and how to enhance community influence and member retention through these practical activities.\r\n\r\nParticipants will gain insights into how the Taiwanese in Data Science community has designed and planned activities over the past year, and how these activities have contributed to community development and expanded its social impact. This session is particularly suited for managers and organizers who are committed to enhancing community value and influence.",

The business wants to glean insights and value from the data that\u2019s generated over time by your OLTP applications, and the simplest way to do that is often just to run analytics queries directly on your application database.\r\n\r\nOf course, this almost certainly involves running complex queries, joining data from multiple tables, and working on large data sets. If your database and code are optimised for performance of your day-to-day application activity, you\u2019re likely to slow down your application and find yourself with analytics queries that take far too long to run.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s have a look at some of the techniques you can use to optimise your database for an analytics workload without compromising the performance of your application.",

We'll look at some of the impacts this type of workload could have on the application, and why it could cause the analytics queries themselves to perform poorly. \r\n\r\nWe'll then look at a number of different strategies, tools and techniques that can prevent the two workloads from impacting each other. We will look at things such as architecture choices, configuration parameters, materialized views and external tools. \r\n\r\nThe focus will be on PostgreSQL, but most of the concepts are relevant to other database systems.",

I will share the kind of soft skills and technical skills that I picked up when contributing to Python based Apache Airflow followed by showing how the Python based Frappe framework developer CLI tools eases the process of setting the development environment. Then I will add the learning through another Open source project Listmonk, a golang based tool that manages the newsletter and mailing list manager. In that process I learnt how two languages are distinct in their own way and witnessed how raw SQL queries are used in a project.  I have primarily contributed to Apache Airflow project and fixed few issues in Frappe and Listmonk. This talk outlines the learning that I gathered through these 3 projects.",
        "description": "Some of the skills that I learned through Apache Airflow include the importance of reading other pull requests, the written form of communication being so powerful, code is not an asset, and don't worry about throwing it away. With Frappe my learning while setting up the development mode in my computer showed how I can set up multiple apps into development mode through DNS-based multitenancy. Then I will walk through the next project that I tried my hands-on, Listmonk a Golang-based tool to learn more about coding in Golang. In that process, I learned how that language is distinct from Python. This is also a project that uses direct raw SQL queries rather than ORM. That led me to find out more about how parameterized queries and prepared statements can be used to avoid SQL injections. My intent in showing all three different open source projects is to show how each project has different things to offer and the sort of learning process that each projects would kickstart in your mind. I will focus on the glimpse of each learning rather than taking a deep technical dive to show how Open Source can offer a wide range of learning for each person. I hope this will lead the listeners to explore Open source projects and learn from it in their own way.",

        "description": 'As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning continue to revolutionize industries, the ethical responsibility of safeguarding personal and sensitive data has become a central issue. In fields ranging from healthcare to finance, AI-driven applications are increasingly relying on large datasets, many of which contain sensitive personal information. However, as data usage grows, so do concerns about privacy breaches and misuse. High-profile data breaches and the misuse of personal information have triggered global regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States. These regulations impose strict requirements on data handling, making it essential for developers and data scientists to integrate privacy-preserving techniques into their workflows to ensure compliance while maintaining trust with users.\r\nIn this session, titled "Preserving Privacy in AI: Techniques and Tools for Secure Machine Learning," we will explore how to harness the power of AI while protecting individual privacy. The goal is to equip attendees with both a theoretical understanding and practical tools for implementing privacy-preserving AI techniques. We\u2019ll cover real-world solutions that allow AI systems to extract value from data while minimizing the risk of exposing sensitive information. By addressing the challenge of balancing privacy with innovation, this talk provides actionable insights for developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts alike.\r\nAt the heart of this discussion will be three key techniques that represent the forefront of privacy-preserving AI: Differential Privacy, Federated Learning, and Homomorphic Encryption. Differential Privacy is a method that adds controlled noise to datasets, ensuring that the contribution of any individual\u2019s data cannot be discerned while still allowing meaningful insights to be drawn. This technique has been successfully adopted by large-scale companies like Apple and Google to anonymize user data in their products while maintaining high standards of privacy.\r\nFederated Learning offers a decentralized approach to machine learning by enabling AI models to be trained on devices without requiring raw data to be transferred to a central server. This technique allows organizations to benefit from insights across distributed data sources, such as smartphones or hospitals, without collecting the actual data itself. It is especially useful for applications like predictive text, where data from users\u2019 devices can be leveraged to improve algorithms without breaching their privacy.\r\nHomomorphic Encryption is another powerful tool that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data, meaning sensitive information never needs to be decrypted during the analysis process. This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unintelligible to attackers. Homomorphic Encryption is particularly valuable in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare, where sensitive data must remain protected throughout its lifecycle.\r\nIn addition to exploring these privacy-preserving techniques, we\u2019ll delve into the open-source Python libraries that enable developers and data scientists to implement these methods in their own workflows.\r\nSo in this talk, attendees will learn how privacy-preserving techniques can help comply with regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA, while also building AI systems that foster trust and transparency. As AI continues to be integrated into everyday life, users are becoming more aware of how their data is being used. By adopting privacy-first practices, organizations can demonstrate a commitment to ethical AI, helping to build and maintain user trust.\r\nThis session is designed to be accessible to a wide audience, whether you\u2019re new to AI or an experienced developer looking to expand your skillset in privacy-preserving techniques.',

Each relationship is a property that the program must satisfy.\r\n    - The behavior of the program is explicit.\r\n    - Pair the properties with an input data generator and cover more cases.\r\n\r\n### Example - Sort Program\r\n\r\n(7 minutes)\r\n\r\n- Walk through code for an example-based test.\r\n    - A buggy sort program can appear to \u201cpass\u201d the tests if it were implemented as a big if-else statement tailored around the inputs used in the tests.\r\n- Walk through code for a property-based test\r\n    - Define properties of sort:\r\n        - 1) Length of input should equal length of sorted output.\r\n        - 2) Set of input should be the same as the set of sorted output.\r\n        - 3) The output should be in sorted order.\r\n    - Write an is_valid_<property>() function for each property (aka assertion method).\r\n    - Write an input generator, or use the strategies from Hypothesis library.\r\n    - A buggy sort program is more likely to be caught failing one of the generated input.\r\n    - For the failing input, you can add it explicitly as an example-based test.\r\n\r\n### When to use it, when not to use it\r\n\r\n(3 minutes)\r\n\r\n- Don\u2019t use it for simple programs that have few cases, especially if generating a lot of input data is not necessary.\r\n- Do use it for complex situations when there are many edge cases and you might miss some if you were writing only example-based tests.\r\n- Do pair it with example-based tests.",

        "description": "Open source software is often viewed through the lens of coding, with developers being seen as the primary drivers behind projects. However, the reality is that open source communities rely on a wide range of contributions that extend far beyond writing code. These no-code contributions are essential to the growth, sustainability, and overall success of any project, including those built in Python. Whether you are a community manager, writer, designer, or someone with a passion for organization and collaboration, there are numerous ways you can make a meaningful impact without coding knowledge.\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed to empower individuals who want to contribute to Python open source projects but don\u2019t necessarily have a technical background. We'll explore the various roles no-code contributors can take on and how they can help projects thrive.\r\n\r\nKey Areas of No-Code Contributions:\r\nDocumentation\r\nOne of the most critical components of any open source project is its documentation. Well-written, clear, and user-friendly documentation is crucial for both onboarding new users and helping existing contributors understand the project's goals and functions. Whether it's writing \"getting started\" guides, tutorials, or improving technical documentation, writers play a vital role in making a project accessible to everyone.\r\nCommunity Management\r\nManaging the community around an open source project is a massive responsibility. This includes welcoming new contributors, organizing meetings or events, moderating discussions, and creating an inclusive environment where people feel comfortable participating. As a community manager, you help facilitate communication, build relationships, and ensure the health and longevity of the community.\r\nProject Management\r\nProject management is an often-overlooked but highly valuable aspect of open source projects. Keeping track of issues, pull requests, and project milestones ensures that teams stay on track and that contributors know where they can help. Non-technical contributors can assist in managing timelines, organizing sprints, and ensuring that projects are moving forward smoothly.\r\nDesign and User Experience (UX)\r\nMany open source projects could benefit from improved design and user experience. Whether it\u2019s creating logos, designing website layouts, or improving user interface (UI) elements, designers play a crucial role in ensuring that the project is visually appealing and user-friendly. Great design can help attract new users and contributors, making the project more accessible and enjoyable to interact with.\r\nMarketing and Outreach\r\nGetting the word out about an open source project is essential for attracting users and contributors. No-code contributors can assist by managing social media accounts, writing blog posts, creating newsletters, and engaging with the broader community. These activities help raise awareness about the project and build a wider audience, which in turn brings more contributors and momentum to the project.\r\nEvent Organization\r\nOrganizing hackathons, workshops, and conferences is another powerful way to contribute. These events provide a space for contributors to come together, share ideas, and collaborate. Event organization requires coordination, communication, and a passion for fostering community involvement, making it an ideal role for\u00a0non-developers.\r\n\r\nReal-World Examples of No-Code Contributions:\r\nThroughout the Python open source ecosystem, there are numerous examples of no-code contributors who have made substantial impacts. Some notable success stories include:\r\n\r\nDocumentation Overhaul: A writer joined a Python project and revamped the documentation, making it more accessible to beginners. This led to a significant increase in new contributors who found it easier to understand the project and get involved.\r\nCommunity Growth: A non-developer started organizing regular meetups and online events for a Python project, which created a welcoming space for both newcomers and experienced contributors. Over time, the community grew substantially, leading to more active development and collaboration.\r\nMarketing Strategy: A marketing enthusiast took charge of a Python project\u2019s social media channels, consistently sharing updates, tutorials, and success stories. This visibility helped the project gain attention, attract sponsors, and grow its user base.\r\nHow to Get Started:\r\nIf you're interested in contributing to Python open source projects without coding, here are some steps to help you get started:\r\n\r\nIdentify Your Strengths: Think about what you\u2019re good at and how those skills can benefit an open source project. Are you a good writer, organizer, designer, or communicator? There's a place for everyone.\r\nExplore Python Projects: Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Open Source Python communities host a wide range of Python projects that welcome no-code contributors. Search for projects that align with your interests.\r\nEngage with the Community: Once you find a project you're interested in, join the community. This could mean participating in discussions, joining chat groups (e.g., on Slack, Discord, or IRC), or attending virtual meetups. Building relationships with other contributors is essential for understanding where your help is most needed.\r\nStart Small: You don\u2019t have to make a huge contribution right away. Begin with smaller tasks like improving a section of documentation, moderating a community discussion, or organizing an online event. As you become more familiar with the project, you can take on more responsibilities.\r\nStay Consistent: No-code contributions, just like coding, require commitment. Consistency in participation and communication can lead to long-term involvement and greater impact. The more engaged you are, the more opportunities will open up for you.\r\nConclusion:\r\nNo-code contributions are a vital part of the Python open source ecosystem. Without the efforts of writers, designers, community managers, and project organizers, many projects would struggle to grow and remain sustainable. By bringing your unique skills and passion to the table, you can help create better, more inclusive open source projects and foster a thriving community. Python, with its vast and diverse ecosystem, offers a welcoming space for no-code contributors to get involved and make a real difference.\r\n\r\nOpen source is for everyone, and your contributions\u2014whether in code or not\u2014are valued and needed. Join the movement and start making an\u00a0impact\u00a0today!",

Our talk aims to enlighten people about the history of programming while simultaneously discussing the progress and participation of women in coding. Along with facts, this talk will not only help in supporting and motivating the aspiring women in coding but also shed light on the challenges that women have faced in the past. We are familiar with names like Alan Turing and Robert Kahn, but this talk will discuss the exceptional works of Dr. Grace Hopper, who wrote the first computer compiler and Ada Lovelace, who is considered to be the first computer programmer while having an IQ of 160, matching that of Einstein. Women are underrepresented in tech while also being underpaid. Despite the fact that only 28% of women are in tech, during World War II, women operated some of the first computational machines used for code-breaking. There has been a rise and fall and rise of women in programming and conferences like Pyladies, support and encourage women coding in python. Due to such conferences, there has been slow incremental progress. Django Girls is a workshop where women are incentivized to participate due to their cupcakes and free pizza! Women have the amazing ability to be creative while also being able to adapt their solutions according to the challenges they face. There are so many success stories, where learning coding especially in Python as it is fairly easy, has helped people survive, change their career path totally. This talk will hopefully motivate women who are apprehensive about learning coding. This will also discuss some of my personal experiences as a woman in Computer Science.",

However, it is difficult to quantity the impact of spatially-explicit water management practices for thousands of individual agricultural fields across the United States. This is where Python comes in. This presentation will provide an overview of the collaborative effort to develop a Python-based tool capable of quantifying the impacts of water quantity and water quality management practices on agricultural fields. Specifically, we will discuss ESMC\u2019s needs, the general structure and function of the tool, and how we leveraged open-source Python libraries, publicly available geospatial datasets, and scientifically-based hydrological approaches to meet project goals. We will end with lessons learned and tips for PyLadies looking to venture into Python tool development for scientific applications.",

Python, with its simplicity and versatility, stands out as a powerful tool for nurturing creativity in young minds. This talk, "Igniting Young Minds: Sparking Creativity in Kids through Python," explores how coding can fuel imagination and innovation in children, alongside developing logical skills.\r\n\r\nPython acts as a canvas, allowing kids to express their ideas through code. Rather than focusing on memorizing syntax, Python encourages an intuitive understanding of concepts, helping children think creatively as they build solutions. Libraries like Turtle, Pygame Zero, Tkinter transform abstract ideas into interactive art, animations, games, and apps, giving kids the freedom to explore, experiment, and bring their unique ideas to life. These tools provide a playful, hands-on approach to coding that keeps learning engaging and fun.\r\n\r\nBy focusing on the creative side of coding, we can inspire children to see technology not just as a set of rules but as a space for exploration and invention. This talk will highlight how Python enables young learners to blend logic with creativity, allowing them to design, innovate, and imagine without boundaries.',

It's not just about writing code\u2014Python acts as a dynamic platform where kids can shape their ideas and explore new possibilities. In a world where technology surrounds us, teaching Python provides children with the tools to interact with the digital landscape in ways that are both imaginative and impactful.\r\n\r\nRather than focusing on memorizing commands, Python nurtures creativity by encouraging children to think conceptually and solve problems in innovative ways. In this talk, we'll explore the creative side of coding and demonstrate how Python offers an ideal starting point for children to build their coding skills while fueling their curiosity.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll dive into how Python libraries like Turtle and Pygame Zero can be used to transform abstract ideas into engaging art, animations, and games. These tools allow children to explore coding in a fun, hands-on manner that keeps their interest piqued while nurturing their creative expression.\r\n\r\nBy introducing kids to Python, we can guide them through a world where they can think independently, innovate boldly, and express their unique ideas with confidence.",

This talk explores the potential for automatic tools that bridge the communication gap for Deaf and hard-of-hearing people through the use of sign language. We will delve into the current challenges and advancements in developing AI-powered systems capable of understanding, translating, and generating sign language in real time. By examining the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and linguistics, we aim to address the pivotal question: Can technology truly enhance accessibility without compromising the richness and complexity of sign languages? Join us as we explore the future of communication and inclusion through innovative solutions designed to empower those relying on sign language.",
        "description": "This talk explores the progress and limitations of automatic sign language. I see more and more tools being created without involving the community. I'd like to raise awareness among people who create inclusive tools of the importance of involving the people concerned. Before creating a tool, ask yourself whether it's useful or not and contact the people concerned to see whether it's worthwhile.\r\nAs deaf myself and French, I see so many tools that focus on sign language that are useless apart from the wow factor.",

We\u2019ll explore how ASTx can be applied to different programming languages and showcase examples, including a Fibonacci function. Whether you're developing your own language or creating custom code analysis tools, ASTx provides an intuitive and powerful interface to help you work with ASTs efficiently.",
        "description": "The ASTx project, a component of the ArxLang ecosystem, serves as an agnostic Python framework for constructing and representing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). Its primary objective is to provide a versatile and language-independent structure for ASTs, primarily catering to the needs of the ArxLang project but with the flexibility to be utilized across various programming languages and parsing tools. \r\nASTx supports various data types such as integer, float and boolean, as well as features like control flow elements and operators. When it comes to visualization, ASTx supports Graphviz and console-based visualization. Both are very helpful for graphical interpretation and debugging, but the ascii-based console visualization has added versatility for use during a pdb session, for example.With all these features, ASTx is a intuitive and powerful interface that can be used to create custom code analysis tools or develop your own language.",

Let's talk a bit about preparing your documentation, your tests, your tools, and your mentors so you're resilient and ready for a potential flood of new contributors.",
        "description": "I once worked with a women in tech organization that asked me to run a hackathon with about a week of warning, and they were totally taken aback when I said that wasn't enough time -- I'd done hackathons in the past, surely it was a thing I could throw together in time for their conference?\r\n\r\nThe best mentoring events take a lot of preparation.  It's very easy to run an event where people feel like they didn't do much, or they didn't understand things, or things didn't work, or where the experienced folk got stuff done and the beginners got stuck and no one noticed.    It takes more preparation to run events where you really manage to onboard people to your project, or at least let them get a real taste of contributing.\r\n\r\nI've been running Google Summer of Code for the Python Software Foundation for a decade or so and participated in a lot of hackathons and code sprints.    I love these events, but one of the biggest problems is that you often get a whole lot of contributors showing up at once, more than your mentors can handle in an ideal world.  Sometimes they're very anxious and pushy, especially in cases where there are prizes or money involved.  It's hard.\r\n\r\nSo let's talk about how to prepare.  First, documentation: how much do you need?  How do you test it? How can you empower your new contributors to help?\r\n\r\nSecond, tests and automation.  Let's talk about linters, test coverage, and tools like pre-commit that might help people get quick feedback even if there's no mentor available.\r\n\r\nThird, let's talk about bugs for new users, how to triage your issues list, and help let people self-direct.\r\n\r\nFinally, let's talk about mentoring your mentors: how to use a buddy system, how to check in with the mentors, getting post-flood feedback, and keeping your mentors from burning out. I use buddy system for running whole programs and it helped Python-GSoC run smoothly when I had a kid.",

This sharing proposes a simple and sustainable text analysis framework based on Python, designed to help community members and policymakers extract valuable insights from discussion data. The proposed framework integrates text mining techniques and sentiment analysis, and dynamic dashboards, utilizing methods such as topic modeling and text similarity calculations to automatically identify key topics, sentiment trends, and similar suggestions within discussions.\r\n\r\nWhile still in development, this project emphasizes the sustainability of the approach. Leveraging Python's open-source tools and libraries, I hope to provide a modular analysis process that allows users of varying technical backgrounds to quickly adopt and apply it flexibly to various community policy discussion contexts, and help enable community members to engage more effectively and influence policy decisions.\r\n\r\nAs this project is in its early stages, ongoing efforts focus on refining the methodology and validating its applicability in real-world scenarios. The potential applications combine policy analysis with data science methodologies.",
        "description": "In Taiwan, every summer, government agencies designate a major theme and invite young people to form teams and propose deliberative democracy discussion activities. Each year, there are over 30 such discussions. For each session, reading materials are prepared on the topic, and a final conclusion report is presented. How can these be utilized in policy-making? How can qualitative discussions be quantified to enhance the effectiveness of discussion results? Python offers numerous open-source packages and tools that are well-suited for civic tech applications, improving the quality of civic discussions and policy decisions.\r\n\r\nPyLadies is a community where we experience support and empowerment. I hope to extend Python's reach and our community's resilience through this platform, empowering more citizens and issue advocates.",

We'll begin with a brief introduction to the Array API standard and its benefits, focusing on its impact on cross-library functions and model training speed. Next, we'll examine a detailed example of a scikit-learn kernel that shows significant performance improvements due to the Array API. Currently in scikit-learn, users can choose to use Array API by enabling or disabling a flag called \"array_api_dispatch.\" We'll demonstrate how to turn on this flag during the tutorial and showcase the resulting performance changes. By the end of this talk, attendees will have a high-level understanding of the Array API standard and know how to use it in their own scikit-learn projects.",
        "description": "The talk will begin with a personal introduction, detailing my background, current role, and involvement with scikit-learn. I'll then provide a brief overview of the Array API standard and direct attendees to the official page for more information. Next, I'll explain the benefits of adopting the Array API standard, including GPU utilization with Torch or CuPy (as opposed to just NumPy), JIT compiler advantages, and distributed computing capabilities with DASK. However, I'll note that scikit-learn is currently focused primarily on GPU utilization.\r\n\r\nThe core of this presentation will be a code example demonstrating the significant increase in processing speed when enabling the array_api_dispatch flag. I'll start by showing and explaining an estimator that supports Array API. Then, I'll train a model using this estimator without the array_api_dispatch flag (CPU training), using time.perf_counter to measure the fitting duration. Following this, I'll enable the flag and retrain the model (GPU training), again tracking the time. We'll compare the training times with and without the flag enabled, highlighting the substantial speed improvement with array_api_dispatch turned on.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I'll showcase a meta issue in the scikit-learn GitHub repository that tracks Array API-related issues, providing attendees with a resource for further exploration and potential contribution.",

This talk delves into the two primary evaluation methodologies: reference-based and referenceless techniques.\r\n\r\nReference-based evaluation relies on predefined ground truth references to assess the quality of generated text. Metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR are commonly used to compare the generated output against these references, providing insights into the model\u2019s accuracy and fluency. However, these metrics often fall short in capturing the nuances of human language and creativity.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, referenceless evaluation techniques, such as BERTScore, perplexity, and human judgment, offer a complementary perspective by assessing the coherence, relevance, and overall quality of the generated text without relying on reference texts. These methods can better capture the subtleties of language generation and provide a more holistic view of model performance.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore the strengths and limitations of both evaluation approaches, highlighting recent advancements and practical applications. This talk is suitable for anyone who has basic understanding of NLP and LLMs and want to know more about evaluation stratergies",

        "abstract": "Infectious diseases are the third leading cause of death worldwide, claiming more than 13 million lives every year. While there are many interventions available for managing epidemics \u2013 including vaccines, tests and treatments \u2013 the best approach is not always clear. There are complex dynamics at play, with many interacting variables, and the optimal response may vary significantly depending on outbreak severity, funding available, and even sociopolitical context. \r\n\r\nComputational modelling is a highly effective way to examine the potential impact of different public health interventions. However, the technical difficulty of building fit-for-purpose models that can simulate these impacts and produce quantitative optimisations is a barrier to widespread use.\r\n\r\nAtomica is a Python-based simulation engine for compartmental modelling. It provides an easy-to-use yet highly configurable way to build disease models, with built-in support for interventions and optimisation with budget constraints. By leveraging population, transmission, and public health intervention data, as well as conceptual knowledge of how people progress through stages of disease, we can forecast the potential consequences of different public health strategies in specific countries or settings. With this insight, we can help governments to make the best possible decisions on what to prioritise, saving lives in the process. \r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a beginner or an expert Pythonista, this talk will equip you with the tools to simulate a real-world epidemic and optimise funding distribution for maximum impact.",
        "description": "**Description for reviewers**\r\nIn this talk, I will introduce attendees to a simple SIR disease model ( [Susceptible] --> [Infected] --> [Recovered] ). I will walk them through how to use the Atomica package to run a simulation of this disease model (or any infectious epidemic, as the steps are the same), using the in-built optimisation algorithm to generate a bar plot of the recommended funding allocations for a given budget. \r\n\r\nSince Atomica has so much in-built functionality for modelling these systems, the walkthrough is simple enough that the topic of the presentation can easily be covered in 15 minutes. \r\n\r\n**Outline**\r\nIntroduction (2 min):\r\n\u2022\tGlobal impact of infectious diseases \r\n\u2022\tBasic infectious disease dynamics ( [Susceptible] --> [Infected] --> [Recovered] )\r\nUsing Atomica to model a simple epidemic (8-9 mins total): \r\n\u2022\t1.

However, not all data visualizations are accessible to everyone, particularly individuals with disabilities, such as visual impairments or cognitive challenges. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll discuss some principles and best practices for creating more accessible data visualizations. It will include tips for data scientists and analysts who create visualizations, as well as guidelines for the developers of visualization software to provide accessibility affordances in their libraries.",
        "description": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 1.3 billion people (i.e., 1 in 6 individuals) experience a disability, and nearly 2.2 billion people (1 in 5 individuals) have vision impairment. Improving the accessibility of visualizations will enable more people to participate and engage with our data analyses.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will:\r\n\r\n- Examine accessibility fundamentals of visual elements such as color contrast, alternative text descriptions, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and more\r\n- Incorporate these into our data visualizations with practical tips and specific example for common plots\r\n- Understand the accessibility limitations of widely used Python data visualization tools and libraries, and outline ways to improve them\r\n\r\nThis talk is inspired by the accessibility audit and improvements we\u2019re working in the [Bokeh visualization library](https://bokeh.org/), a tool to create interactive visualizations in web browsers. The talk will include learnings from on ongoing work. \r\n\r\nWe hope this talk enables you to make your next data visualization, and your visualization tools, more accessible.",

        "description": 'This two-part panel series, "Empowering Change: Building and Amplifying the PyLadies Community as Black Women in Tech," will feature conversations with leaders, trailblazers, and community organizers dedicated to driving inclusivity and resilience within the Python and tech communities. Focused on the unique experiences and contributions of Black women, the sessions will address the challenges they face, the opportunities they pursue, and the impact they are making through PyLadies and beyond. \r\n\r\nThe panel will be split into two thematic sessions and 40 mins for each, each designed to inspire and equip attendees with the tools, insights, and encouragement necessary to thrive in tech.\r\n\r\nPanel Session 1: Navigating Challenges and Seizing Opportunities\r\n\r\nIn the first session, panelists will discuss the specific experiences and opportunities that Black women face in the tech industry. This segment is dedicated to opening up honest conversations on overcoming adversity, embracing opportunities, and building community.\r\n\r\nUnique Challenges Faced by Black Women in Tech; Black women in tech often navigate a range of challenges, including underrepresentation, workplace biases, and limited access to mentorship and resources. This part of the discussion will spotlight the obstacles that come with being a Black woman in a field where their numbers remain low. Panelists will draw on personal experiences to share how they address and overcome these challenges, fostering resilience along the way. By providing visibility into these unique challenges, the panel aims to encourage solidarity, validate experiences, and empower others facing similar struggles.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for Growth and Empowerment; Despite the challenges, Black women in tech have continuously found and leveraged opportunities for growth. This segment will explore the various pathways for advancement available to women in the Python community. Panelists will discuss how to identify growth opportunities, from professional networking and career development to leadership training. Additionally, they\u2019ll share advice on amplifying one\u2019s voice, contributing to open-source projects, and using community resources as a launchpad for personal and professional empowerment. The discussion will highlight practical approaches to taking charge of one\'s career and the support systems that make it possible.\r\n\r\nImpact of PyLadies in Fostering Inclusivity;  As a global network dedicated to promoting women in Python, PyLadies has become a vital space for inclusivity and community building. This part of the panel will look at how PyLadies fosters an environment where women feel empowered, supported, and represented. Panelists will discuss the role PyLadies plays in addressing the needs of Black women in tech and the ways in which it has provided a safe space for sharing resources, building connections, and advancing careers. Attendees will learn about PyLadies\u2019 ongoing initiatives, the significance of creating such inclusive spaces, and how they can get involved in these efforts to amplify diversity in tech.\r\n\r\nPanel Session 2: Building Community, Mentorship, and Confidence\r\n\r\nIn the second session, the conversation will shift to practical strategies for growth, the importance of mentorship, and the role of self-confidence in navigating the tech industry. This segment is designed to empower attendees with actionable tools for building a community-driven and personally fulfilling career.\r\n\r\nStrategies for Community Growth and Impact; A thriving community is essential for lasting change and progress. In this segment, panelists will share strategies they have used within the PyLadies community to foster growth and create a positive impact. Topics will include how to structure local events, initiatives that attract new members, and ways to create a supportive environment where members feel empowered to contribute. Panelists will also discuss the importance of inclusive programming and sustainable community building practices. By the end of this discussion, attendees will have learned tangible strategies to apply to their own communities, whether locally or globally, to encourage growth and amplify impact.\r\n\r\nMentorship and Community-Driven Change; Mentorship is a cornerstone of support for Black women in tech, providing them with access to guidance, knowledge, and career advancement opportunities. This part of the session will delve into the role of mentorship in driving positive change within PyLadies and beyond. Panelists will discuss how mentorship within the PyLadies community has empowered them and those they mentor to develop skills, confidence, and a sense of belonging. They will also highlight the importance of \u201cpaying it forward\u201d by becoming mentors themselves. Attendees will come away with insights on how to seek and provide mentorship, as well as how to leverage community-driven mentorship programs to promote diversity and inclusivity.\r\n\r\nOvercoming Impostor Syndrome and Building Confidence; Impostor syndrome and self-doubt are common struggles, particularly for Black women in predominantly male-dominated fields. This part of the panel will address the effects of impostor syndrome on career progression, productivity, and mental health. Panelists will share their own experiences of overcoming self-doubt and the tools they\u2019ve used to build self-confidence in challenging environments. They\u2019ll offer practical advice on how to reframe negative thoughts, recognize achievements, and take ownership of one\u2019s unique skills and contributions. By exploring these personal journeys, attendees will gain a fresh perspective on navigating self-doubt and building confidence as they move forward in their careers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis panel series is designed to leave attendees with a renewed sense of purpose, actionable strategies for growth, and an empowered mindset. We aim to inspire attendees to contribute actively to their own communities and to take steps toward a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.
